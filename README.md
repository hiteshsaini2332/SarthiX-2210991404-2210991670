## 🌟 Overview

SarthiX is a B2B logistics platform built for the Indian freight market. It enables **shippers** to post loads and receive competitive bids from **drivers**, with real-time GPS tracking, permit compliance monitoring, and a transparent rating system.

```
Shipper posts shipment → Drivers place bids → Shipper accepts best bid
→ Material loaded notification → Driver starts transit (GPS tracking begins)
→ Driver uploads proof-of-delivery → Shipment marked delivered → Rating
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

<div align="center">

![Sarthix Banner](https://img.shields.io/badge/Sarthix-Logistics%20Platform-f97316?style=for-the-badge&logo=data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMjQiIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgZmlsbD0id2hpdGUiIHhtbG5zPSJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZyI+PHBhdGggZD0iTTIwIDhIMTdWNkgzQzEuOSA2IDEgNi45IDEgOFYxN0gzQTMgMyAwIDAgMCA5IDE3SDEzQTMgMyAwIDAgMCAxOSAxN0gyMVY4SDIwWiIvPjwvc3ZnPg==)

### 🚀 [Explore the Live App](https://sarthi-x-eight.vercel.app/)

</div>

### Prerequisites
- Node.js ≥ 18
- A [Supabase](https://supabase.com) project
- A [Clerk](https://clerk.com) application

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sarthix.git
cd sarthix
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
# Frontend
cd frontend && npm install

# Backend
cd ../backend && npm install
```

### 3. Set up environment variables

See [Environment Variables](#-environment-variables) below.

### 4. Run the database migrations

Run these SQL scripts in your Supabase SQL Editor in order:

```bash
# Core schema (users, shipments, bids, trips, permits, notifications)
supabase/migrations/001_core_schema.sql

# Shipment images
supabase/migrations/002_shipment_images.sql

# Vehicle documents
ALTER TABLE public.vehicles ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS document_url text;

# Live tracking
supabase/migrations/003_tracking.sql
```

### 5. Create Supabase Storage buckets

| Bucket | Public | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `shipment-images` | ✅ | Shipment photos uploaded by shippers |
| `vehicle-documents` | ✅ | Vehicle registration documents |

### 6. Start development servers

```bash
# Backend (port 5000)
cd backend && npm run dev

# Frontend (port 5173)
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

---

## 🔑 Environment Variables

### Frontend `.env`
```env
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJ...
```

### Backend `.env`
```env
PORT=5000
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJ...
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

---


### Shipment Status Flow
```
open → assigned → in_transit → delivered
                ↘ cancelled
```

---



## 👥 Role-Based Access

```
New user → RoleSelect screen → chooses Driver or Company
                                        ↓
                          ┌─────────────┴──────────────┐
                      DriverApp                   CompanyApp
                    (role: driver)              (role: company)
```

Role is set once and cannot be changed. `AuthGate` reads `dbUser.role` from `GET /api/users/me` and routes accordingly.

---

## 📍 Live Tracking

```
Driver (in_transit)
  → navigator.geolocation.watchPosition()
  → PATCH /api/shipments/:id/location  (every 10 seconds)
  → Supabase: shipment_locations table (UPSERT on shipment_id)
  → Supabase Realtime broadcast

Shipper (Track page / dialog)
  → Supabase Realtime subscription on shipment_locations
  → React Query setQueryData on each payload
  → Leaflet map panTo() with smooth animation
  → CartoDB Dark Matter tiles
```

Multiple in-transit shipments are supported — a single GPS watcher pushes to all shipment IDs simultaneously via `Promise.allSettled`.

---

## 🏗 Key Decisions

- **Optimistic updates** on notifications, vehicle delete — immediate UI feedback with rollback on error
- **Separate endpoints** for driver shipments (`GET /shipments` = all open) vs company shipments (`GET /shipments/myshipments` = own only)
- **No `refetchInterval`** on notifications — background polling was reverting optimistic mark-read updates
- **Leaflet dynamic import** — loaded only when map mounts, with `invalidateSize()` after 250ms to fix black screen
- **CartoDB Dark tiles** instead of OSM — matches the dark dashboard theme
- **`useDriverActiveShipments`** — dedicated hook for `assigned` + `in_transit` shipments since `GET /shipments` only returns `open` ones
